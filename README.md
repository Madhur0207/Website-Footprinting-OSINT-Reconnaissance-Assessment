1.Objective.

  To perform reconnaissance and OSINT intelligence gathering on a live website to analyze publicly exposed information, infrastructure details, DNS records, and network paths.

2.Methodology.

  Whois lookup and domain profiling

  DNS enumeration and subdomain mapping

  Traceroute path analysis (Windows & Linux)

  Infrastructure fingerprinting using Netcraft

  Username OSINT reconnaissance using Sherlock

3.Tools Used.

  Parrot OS, Kali Linux, Nslookup, Traceroute, DNSDumpster, Netcraft, DomainTools, Sherlock, Nmap

4.Key Findings.

  Multiple subdomains publicly exposed
  
  Hosting and ASN details publicly available
  
  Network routing paths mapped successfully
  
  DNS records and IP ownership information exposed
  
  OSINT usernames found across multiple platforms

5.Result.

  The assessment demonstrates how attackers can build an attack surface using only publicly available information — highlighting the importance of information disclosure control.
